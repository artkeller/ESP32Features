# ESP32Features
Welcome to ESP32Features, a guide and repository for the current ESP32 SoC family from Espressif Systems. This README provides an overview table of the relevant ESP32 models, based on the official Espressif datasheets and documentation (as of September 2025). The ESP32 series includes a wide range of microcontrollers optimized for IoT applications, edge computing, low-power sensors, and industrial systems—from legacy all-rounders like the classic ESP32 to modern RISC V-based chips with Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, and multi-protocol support (e.g., Zigbee/Thread for Matter-compatible smart homes).

## Deep sleep

### Details

**All** ESP32 models (ESP32, S2, S3, C3, C2, C5, C6, H2, P4) support deep sleep mode, and in most cases, special memory (RTC SRAM or comparable) can be used to back up data during deep sleep. However, there are differences in architecture (RTC SRAM, LP SRAM, or other mechanisms) that affect how and which memory is used for this purpose. 

### Overview: Deep sleep and memory for backing up data

**Deep sleep mode:** All models can enter deep sleep, which shuts down the main processor (HP core) and most peripherals to save power. Certain memory areas remain active to back up data or perform simple tasks.

**RTC SRAM**: In models without a dedicated LP core (ESP32, S2, S3, some C3), the RTC SRAM is the main memory that remains active in deep sleep to back up data or execute ULP co-processor code.

**LP SRAM**: In models with a dedicated LP core (C5, C6, H2, P4), the LP SRAM often takes on this role, as the LP core can remain active in deep sleep and stores its own data/code. The H2 has 4 KB of LP SRAM, but without an LP core, only for data storage and LP peripherals.

**Special cases:** C2 does not have dedicated RTC SRAM or LP SRAM, but there is a small RTC area (not explicitly specified) that offers similar functions. C3 has limited options. H2 is optimized for ultra-low consumption (7 μA deep sleep), with LP SRAM for passive storage.


### Model-specific details

#### ESP32:

- **Deep sleep:** Yes, supported.
- **Memory:** 520 KB SRAM, part of which (not separately specified as “RTC SRAM,” but approx. 8 KB in the RTC domain) remains active in deep sleep. The ULP co-processor (FSM-based) can access it to save data or perform simple tasks.
- **Usage:** Saving variables in the RTC memory area (via RTC memory API), e.g., status data, counters, or sensor values. The ULP can process this data.
- **Limit:** Limited memory compared to newer models; ULP is not as flexible as an LP core.


#### ESP32-S2:

- **Deep sleep:** Yes, supported.
- **Memory:** 16 KB RTC SRAM explicitly in the datasheet, remains active in deep sleep. Two ULP co-pros (RISC-V + FSM, not simultaneous) can access it.
- **Usage:** RTC SRAM can be used for data (e.g., states, configuration data). The RISC-V ULP allows for more complex calculations than the classic ESP32.
- **Limit:** 16 KB is not huge, but sufficient for most sensor or status data.


#### ESP32-S3:

- **Deep sleep:** Yes, supported.
- **Memory:** 16 KB RTC SRAM, remains active in deep sleep. ULP co-pros (RISC-V + FSM) can use this memory.
- **Usage:** Similar to S2, ideal for data such as configurations, sensor values, or small state machines. The ULP RISC-V is programmable for more complex deep sleep logic.
- **Limit:** Like S2, 16 KB RTC SRAM limits the amount of data.


#### ESP32-C3:

- **Deep sleep:** Yes, supported.
- **Memory:** No explicit RTC SRAM, but part of the 400 KB SRAM (approx. 8 KB in the RTC domain, similar to ESP32) remains active in deep sleep. No ULP co-processor, therefore no programming in deep sleep.
- **Usage:** You can save data in the RTC area (via ESP-IDF RTC memory APIs), but without ULP only static storage, no active processing.
- **Limit:** No ULP or LP core limits flexibility; smaller memory area.


#### ESP32-C2:

- **Deep sleep:** Yes, supported.
- **Memory:** No explicit RTC SRAM or LP SRAM. A small RTC area (not quantified in the datasheet, estimated <8 KB) remains active, similar to C3.
- **Usage:** Limited data storage possible in the RTC area (e.g., state variables), but no active processing as there is no ULP or LP core.
- **Limit:** Very limited, as there is no dedicated memory or co-processor.


#### ESP32-C5:

- **Deep sleep:** Yes, supported (HP core off, LP core can remain active).
- **Memory:** 16 KB LP SRAM for the dedicated LP core (RISC-V), remains active in deep sleep. No separate RTC SRAM, as the LP core takes over these tasks.
- **Usage:** LP SRAM can be used for data and code of the LP core running in deep sleep. Ideal for complex low-power logic or data storage.
- **Limit:** 16 KB LP SRAM is sufficient but not huge; LP core offers more flexibility than ULP.


#### ESP32-C6:

- **Deep sleep:** Yes, supported (similar to C5).
- **Memory:** 16 KB LP SRAM for the LP core, remains active in deep sleep. No separate RTC SRAM.
- **Usage:** Like C5, LP SRAM for LP core data/code, suitable for complex deep sleep tasks.
- **Limit:** 16 KB LP SRAM, but more flexible due to LP core.


#### ESP32-H2:

- **Deep sleep:** Yes, supported (optimized for ultra-low consumption, 7 μA).
- **Memory:** 4 KB LP SRAM, remains active in deep sleep. No separate RTC SRAM or dedicated LP core.
- **Usage:** LP SRAM for passive data storage (e.g., state variables, sensor data) in deep sleep; LP peripherals (e.g., timers, sensors) support simple tasks.
- **Limit:** 4 KB LP SRAM is small; no LP core, therefore no complex processing in deep sleep.


#### ESP32-P4:

- **Deep sleep:** Yes, supported (HP cores off, LP core active).
- **Memory:** 32 KB LP SRAM for the LP core, remains active in deep sleep. No RTC SRAM, as LP core takes over low-power tasks.
- **Usage:** LP SRAM for LP core data and code, ideal for demanding low-power applications (e.g., image processing, sensor logic).
- **Limit:** 32 KB is more generous than C5/C6, no significant limitations.

### Summary

- **All** ESP32 models support deep sleep.
- **RTC memory** (or equivalent) for data backup on all models
- **ESP32, S2, S3:** RTC SRAM (16 KB on S2/S3, smaller range on classic ESP32) for data storage, supported by ULP co-pros.
- **C3, C2:** Small RTC area (not explicitly specified, <8 KB), only for static data storage, no ULP/LP core.
- **C5, C6, H2, P4:** LP SRAM (16 KB for C5/C6, 32 KB for P4) for data storage and LP core tasks, more flexible than RTC SRAM.
- **Differences:** Models with ULP (ESP32, S2, S3) or LP core (C5, C6, H2, P4) offer more flexibility as they can actively execute code in deep sleep. C3 and C2 are limited (storage only, no processing).
- **C5, C6, H2, P4** can also use the LP core to be active **in deep sleep**.

## Thorough evaluation of each model

Based on the official Espressif datasheets (as of September 2025) and the details collected from the sources, each ESP32 model is analyzed in terms of its advantages and disadvantages. The focus is on **key usability**, i.e., how the features (architecture, memory, radios, interfaces, power) optimize the model for specific areas of application. The evaluation takes into account factors such as performance, energy efficiency, cost, compatibility (e.g., RISC-V vs. Xtensa), wireless options, and peripherals. Models with RISC-V are future-oriented (better for open source), while Xtensa is established. Newer models (C series, H2, P4) emphasize low power and multi-protocol (e.g., Matter), while older models (Classic, S2, S3) are more general but consume more power.

### Useful combinations of ESP32 models

Based on the previous analyses (architecture, radios, interfaces, advantages/disadvantages, and applications), potential combinations were identified that complement the strengths of the models. For example, a model without radios (e.g., P4) is compensated for by a wireless model (e.g., C6), or a low-power model (e.g., H2) extends a high-performance model (e.g., S3). The focus is on meaningful pairs/trios (not all possible ones, as Classic + S2 would be redundant, for example), prioritizing complementarity (e.g., processing + connectivity). For each combination: description of why it makes sense and applications (simple to demanding, including Industry 4.0 with a focus on edge computing, predictive maintenance, secure gateways, and multi-protocol networks).
